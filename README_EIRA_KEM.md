# EIRA-KEM: Post-Quantum Key Encapsulation Mechanism

This repository contains an academic implementation of **EIRA-KEM**, a symbolic algebra-based key encapsulation mechanism designed for post-quantum cryptography.

## Description

EIRA-KEM uses symbolic matrix algebra, high-entropy randomness, and AES-GCM-based authenticated encryption to securely exchange symmetric keys. The construction is post-quantum by design and offers high flexibility in key sizes and performance.

## Usage
